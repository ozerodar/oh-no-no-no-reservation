# oh-no-no-no-reservation
Simple parking spot reservation system created during UNIT competition

Requirements:
1. flask (pip3 install flask) - for the server
2. copy, datetime, json - for the rest

How to run the code:
Run in Terminal:
1. export FLASK_APP=server.py
2. flask run (localhost) or flask run --host <host> for example flask run --host 192.168.0.66

Note: you can run only the reservation part without server to test some stuff. Just run reservation.py
